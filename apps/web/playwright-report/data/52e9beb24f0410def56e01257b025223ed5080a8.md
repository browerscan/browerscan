            - paragraph [ref=e116]: Let me explain this in the simplest way possible. Your computer is like a building with 65,535 doors. Each door (port) is designed for a specific purpose. Door 80 is for regular web traffic. Door 443 is for secure web traffic. Door 22 is for SSH access. Door 3389 is for Remote Desktop. You get the idea.
            - paragraph [ref=e117]: Port scanning is just checking which of those doors are open, closed, or blocked by a security guard (firewall). It is the first thing hackers do when they want to break in - they look for open doors. It is also the first thing security professionals do when they want to protect a system - they check what is exposed. Same technique, different intentions.
            - paragraph [ref=e118]: "Here is what most people do not realize: right now, over 3.5 million systems worldwide have their RDP port (3389) openly accessible from the internet. Over 20 million systems expose SSH port 22. These are not theoretical numbers - these are real systems, right now, waiting to be attacked."

                - heading "Use a Firewall Properly" [level=3] [ref=e267]
                - paragraph [ref=e268]: Configure your firewall to DROP (not reject) packets to unused ports. DROP gives no response, making it look like nothing is there. REJECT tells attackers "something is here."

                - paragraph [ref=e271]: SSH on 22 gets hammered by bots. SSH on 2222 or 22222 gets 99% less automated attacks. Not foolproof, but it filters out the noise. Same for RDP - move it off 3389.

                - paragraph [ref=e274]: RDP should never be exposed to the internet. Put it behind a VPN. Better yet, use a zero trust solution like Cloudflare Access or Tailscale. No exposed ports at all.

            - 'heading "Legal Stuff: Do Not Get Yourself in Trouble" [level=2] [ref=e276]'
            - paragraph [ref=e277]: Port scanning your own systems is 100% legal. Scanning systems you do not own without explicit written permission is illegal in most places. Even if it is technically legal in your jurisdiction, unauthorized scanning will get your IP blacklisted and might trigger investigations.
            - paragraph [ref=e278]: Professional penetration testers operate under formal contracts that define exactly what they can scan. "I was just doing security research" is not a valid legal defense. If you want to learn ethical hacking, use platforms like HackTheBox or TryHackMe where you have explicit permission to scan and attack systems.
          - generic [ref=e279]:
            - heading "Bottom Line" [level=2] [ref=e280]
            - paragraph [ref=e281]: Port scanning is the foundation of both attacking and defending systems. Attackers use it to find your weak points. You should use it to find and fix those weak points first. With over 3.5 million RDP ports and 20 million SSH ports exposed on the internet right now, the attackers have plenty of targets. Do not be one of them. Scan yourself, close what you do not need, and use proper firewalls.
