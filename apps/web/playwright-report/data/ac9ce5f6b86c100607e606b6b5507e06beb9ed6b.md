            - paragraph [ref=e75]: "Here is a number that should grab your attention: in 2024, automated bot traffic officially surpassed human traffic on the internet for the first time in a decade. According to the 2025 Imperva Bad Bot Report, bots now make up 51% of all web traffic. Bad bots alone account for 37% of that traffic, up from 32% just one year earlier. Think about that. More than a third of everything happening on the internet right now is malicious automation trying to scrape data, take over accounts, or commit fraud."
            - paragraph [ref=e76]: This is not some abstract cybersecurity statistic. This directly affects you. If you run a website, bad bots are hitting your servers right now. If you use the internet for banking, shopping, or social media, automated attacks are constantly probing for weaknesses. The security tools on this page help you understand and defend against these threats. They let you see what attackers see when they look at your digital footprint.

            - heading "Understanding IP Intelligence and Why It Matters" [level=2] [ref=e113]
            - paragraph [ref=e114]: Every device on the internet has an IP address. Think of it like your home address, but for your computer. The thing most people do not realize is that this address carries enormous amounts of information with it. When you connect to a website, that site can instantly determine your approximate location, your internet service provider, whether you are using a VPN or proxy, and even calculate a fraud risk score based on your IP history.
            - paragraph [ref=e115]: Our IP Intelligence tool gives you the same visibility that major corporations and fraud detection systems have. You can query any IP address and get back geolocation data, ASN information, VPN and proxy detection, and a fraud score. This is the exact same data that banks use to flag suspicious transactions, that e-commerce sites use to block fraudulent orders, and that streaming services use to enforce geographic restrictions.

            - heading "The Problem with WebRTC and DNS Leaks" [level=2] [ref=e117]
            - paragraph [ref=e118]: "You might be using a VPN to protect your privacy, and you might think you are completely anonymous. Here is the uncomfortable truth: WebRTC leaks can expose your real IP address even when you are connected to a VPN. WebRTC is a browser technology that enables real-time communication like video calls. The problem is that it can bypass your VPN tunnel to establish direct peer-to-peer connections, revealing your actual IP in the process."
            - paragraph [ref=e119]: DNS leaks are equally problematic. When you type a website address, your browser needs to look up the IP address associated with that domain. If these DNS requests go through your ISP instead of your VPN, anyone monitoring your connection can see exactly which websites you are visiting. Our leak test tool checks for both of these vulnerabilities in real-time. If you are paying for a VPN service but your IP is leaking, you are not getting the privacy you think you are paying for.

            - 'heading "Port Scanning: Know Your Attack Surface" [level=2] [ref=e121]'
            - paragraph [ref=e122]: Imagine your computer has thousands of doors. Each door is a port, and each port can potentially be an entry point for attackers. Port 22 is SSH, used for remote server access. Port 3389 is RDP, used for Windows Remote Desktop. Port 3306 is MySQL databases. If these ports are open and exposed to the internet, attackers can probe them, attempt to brute-force credentials, or exploit vulnerabilities in the services running behind them.
            - paragraph [ref=e123]: Our port scanner lets you check which ports are open on your system. This is the first thing an attacker does when targeting a system, so you should know what they can see. If you have ports open that should not be exposed to the internet, that is a security problem you need to fix. Remember, you cannot defend what you do not know about.

            - paragraph [ref=e139]: Cookies get a bad reputation because of tracking, but they serve legitimate purposes too. Session cookies keep you logged in. Preference cookies remember your settings. The security question is how these cookies are configured. A cookie without the Secure flag can be intercepted over unencrypted connections. A cookie without HttpOnly can be stolen by malicious JavaScript. A cookie without proper SameSite configuration can be exploited in cross-site request forgery attacks.
            - paragraph [ref=e140]: Our cookie analyzer shows you the security flags on every cookie in your browser. This is particularly useful if you are a developer auditing your own site, or if you are a security researcher examining how sites handle sensitive data. GDPR regulators have issued hundreds of millions in fines for improper cookie handling. Understanding cookie security is not optional anymore, it is a compliance requirement.

            - paragraph [ref=e143]: Sometimes you need to document your browser fingerprint for audit purposes, share findings with a team, or create a baseline for future comparison. Our PDF report generator takes your complete scan results and exports them as a professional document. This includes your trust score, all detected fingerprint attributes, consistency checks, and any leaks or anomalies we found.
            - paragraph [ref=e144]: Security professionals use these reports for penetration testing documentation, compliance audits, and incident response. Privacy researchers use them to compare fingerprint uniqueness across different browser configurations. Whatever your use case, having a permanent record of your browser fingerprint is valuable information that you control.

            - paragraph [ref=e162]: We built these tools with privacy as a core principle. Most of the analysis happens directly in your browser. When we do need to make server-side requests (like IP intelligence lookups), we do not log your queries or store your results unless you explicitly export them. We do not sell data, we do not build profiles, and we do not track you across sessions. The whole point of these tools is to help you understand and protect your privacy, not to undermine it.
            - paragraph [ref=e163]: If you have questions about our data practices, read our privacy policy or contact us at Privacy@BrowserScan.org. We are transparent about what we collect and why. In a world where 37% of internet traffic is malicious bots, trust is everything. We earn that trust by respecting your privacy.
